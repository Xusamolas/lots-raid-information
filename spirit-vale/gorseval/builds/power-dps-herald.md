# Gorseval: Builds &ndash; Power DPS Herald
{% include templates/messages/build-unfinished.html %}

The Herald will always be in melee range of Gorseval and will share various boons while being in the Legendary Dragon Stance.
While being in this stance, you use various facets to share might and fury, and try to extend the boon duration by using Facet of Nature.
When your energy runs out, swap to your other stance and use whatever is necessary to get as much DPS as possible.

When fast CC is required, you swap to staff and use skill #5, or consume your Facet of Chaos.
Your axe skill #5 can also CC if needed.

## Build
The Herald uses Berserker's gear.
