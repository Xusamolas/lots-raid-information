# Gorseval: Nomenclature
In order to avoid confusion, we use the following terms in the Gorseval fight:

**Phase 1** or **first phase**
: The starting phase of Gorseval when it's above 66% HP.

**Phase 2** or **second phase**
: The second phase of Gorseval when it's between 33% and 66% HP.

**Phase 3** or **third phase**
: The third phase of Gorseval when it's below 33%.

**DPS phase**
: The recurring phase *before the CC phase* where Gorseval has to be significantly damaged while players have to dodge its stomp attack.

**CC phase**
: The recurring phase of Gorseval where it says something (or rather the spirits of which it's made of) just before it teleports to the center.
When it's in the center, it keeps stomping the ground while also spawning large dark blue rings around or on top of itself.
During this phase Gorseval has to be hard CC'd (knockbacks, knockdowns, stuns, dazes, etc.).

**Spirit phase**
: The recurring phase *after the CC phase* where Gorseval summons spirits that are there to annoy players.
Just as the *DPS phase*, Gorseval has to be significantly damaged, along with a wall that leads to one of the 4 updrafts.
To make this even more complicated, the summoned spirits have to be pulled and killed ASAP before gliding.

**Channel phase**
: The recurring phase *during the spirit phase* where Gorseval channels a powerful attack that will wipe every player in the arena.

**Charged Soul phase**
: The recurring phase that occurs between the *numbered phases* (at 66% and 33%).
During this phase, Gorseval is invulnerable and 4 Charged Souls have spawned.
These Charged Souls will walk towards the center where Gorseval is.
If one of them succeeds reaching Gorseval, Gorseval proceeds directly to a *channel phase*.

**Phasing**
: The transitioning of Gorseval from a *numbered phase* into the *Charged Soul phase*.

**Arena**
: The area we are in when we are fighting against Gorseval.

**Barrier**
: The semi-transparent white walls around the arena that prevents you from going both in and out.
They are separated into multiple walls that can be destroyed.

**Updraft**
: There are 4 updrafts in total, located outside the arena: NW, NE, SE and SW.
An updraft will disappear after being used.

**Dark blue ring**
: These dark blue rings are only active when Gorseval is in its *CC phase*.
The rings have a charge timer of 3 seconds before they explode and deal damage to every player that happens to stand on top of it.

**Blue orb**
: These blue orbs will spawn more frequently when the fight progresses.
If a player happens to get caught in its AoE, they get a debuff that significantly lowers their damage.
A golden orb will remove this debuff.

**Golden orb**
: These small orbs will remove the debuff that a player gets when standing in the AoE of a *blue orb*.
It will only remove 5 stacks.

**Trap**
: In the *third phase*, AoE circles will occasionally spawn under every player's feet.
There's only a small time window where a player has to move or dodge out of it before getting encased.
If caught, the player has to spam the special action key or other players have to help by dealing damage.
