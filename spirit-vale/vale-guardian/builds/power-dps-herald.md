# Vale Guardian: Builds &ndash; Power DPS Herald
{% include templates/messages/build-unfinished.html %}

In most raid compositions there will be two Heralds, one for each party. The builds differ slightly, but aim to accomplish the same role. Heralds provide party-wide boons while doing decent DPS on their own.

If you find yourself in the party with the raid's Chronomancer, you should aim to upkeep Facet of Nature at all times. The 50% boon duration it provides can increase the quickness output of the Chronomancer. This means that you are locked at -2 upkeep points the entire fight. As such your legend options are either Glint/Jalis or Glint/Mallyx.
While channelling Glint you should always have Facet of Strength and Facet of Darkness active putting you at -6 upkeep points. Optionally to drain more energy and provide some more group support you can also upkeep Facet of Light at the cost of -1 upkeep. On of the Herald's most important duties is knocking away the seekers during the fight using Facet of Chaos active, however activating the skill for the first time requires 5 available points which at -7 you will not be able to spare. Should that situation arise your best option is to reactivate Facet of Strength, freeing up 2 upkeep points and allowing you to use your elite. Facet of Elements should be used for its' damage component whenever available. In order to drain your energy faster you should use Precision Strike whenever possible. Not only is it a DPS increase, but it also chills allowing you to use it to keep seekers away. Just before your energy is drained you should swap to your other stance with your Facet of Nature still active. There activate Embrace the Darkness or Vengeful Hammers putting you at -9 total energy upkeep cost. Once your energy is about to run out, swap back to Glint and repeat as needed.

If you are not in the Chronomancer's group a few things change. Firstly your legends should now be Glint/Shiro. The rotation doesn't change much, the concept is the same. However this time you are not focusing on Facet of Nature at all. You can freely activate it whenever it's available for the instant boons it provides, just like Facet of Elements. Again you focus on keeping Facets of Strength and Darkness up all the time. Because you are not wasting that -2 on Facet of Nature, you can now activate all 4 of your remaining facets (Strength, Darkness, Light, Chaos) providing your group with Might, Fury, Regeneration and Protection. This will put you at -10 upkeep and drain your energy pretty fast. If you had to reactivate Chaos for the kockback on a seeker using Precision Strike is again an efficient way to drain energy. Once you run out you can switch over to Shiro. Optimally you should wait a couple of seconds and activate Enchanted Daggers, your healing skill which is actually a damage skills as well. Immidiately after you can use Impossible Odds giving yourself quickness and getting the -10 upkeep cost. If properly executed, your legend swap will be off cooldown once you run out of energy and you can repeat this process.

For both cases when CC is required you should swap over to staff and use skill 5 which is an excellent way to demolish breakbars. Also worth mentioning is that Axe 5 is also a pull towards its' center which can be used for breakbars or seekers as well as the Glint elite Facet of Chaos being a knockback.

During the split phases, the Heralds split up and go to the **Green Guardian** and the **Blue Guardian**.
